# Heading Estimation from Optic Flow
A set of methods that estimate heading from optic flow

This directory contains Matlab (R) code to demonstrate the functionality
of the 13 methods that estimate self-motion from generated image flows.

# Getting started
Run one of the two demo scripts (e.g. press F5): "DemoEstSelfMotion.m" or 
"DemoEstSelfMotionGivenDepth.m". The first script includes examples for
the estimation of self-motion from flow. Methods within the second script
estimate self-motion from flow and depth information.

# Bugs
